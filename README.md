# Magical_script_for_ranging_data

This script was written in order to automatically range the teams participating on the competition for publishing the final results on its web-page. Previously, the routine of ranging was done in a semi-manual regime and required almost 4 hours to finish the task. While applying this magical script the required time has been decreased on 8 times (i.e. as low as 30 mins) and allowed avoiding mistypes on the landing.
