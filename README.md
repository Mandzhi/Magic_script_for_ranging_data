# Magical_script_for_data_ranging

Before using the script, the routine of data ranging was done in a semi-manual regime and required almost 4 hours to finish the task. While applying this magical script the required time has been decreased on 8 times (i.e. as low as 30 mins) and allowed avoiding mistypes on the landing. 

The output looks like a nicely sorted list, which includes the following info:

P.S. All data in the dataset was randomly created and is not realistic. It is given only as an example to show the script's capacity.
